# Phonetics Modeling (Python version)

To see a demonstration of the program, without having to install it, please [see the screenshots](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/phonetics-modeling-python/wiki/screenshots).


## How to run
Run the following at the command line:

`python3 main.py`


## How to run the tests:
Type the following line at the command line, and press enter.

`python3 -m unittest`


Plans:
- Create a program that processes phonetics data,  and represents concepts from phonology.
- Use the Python programming language.
- Make it follow closely the design decisions in the phonetics-modeling project at http://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/phonetics-modeling

This is the translation from the Haskell version.


## Current Issues
- more unit test coverage to be added
