# Phonetics Modeling (Python version)
Very little is tested.


This is the translation from the Haskell version.

## How to run
Run the following at the command line:

`python3 main.py`

It doesn't do much, but at least you will know whether the source code compiles.

## How to run the tests:
Type the following line at the command line, and press enter.

`python3 -m unittest`


Plans:
- Create a program that processes phonetics data,  and represents concepts from phonology.
- Use the Python programming language.
- Make it follow closely the design decisions in the phonetics-modeling project at http://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/phonetics-modeling
